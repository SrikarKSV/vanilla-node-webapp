      "confession": "This was back in the late 90's/early 2000's. I was the teachers helper in the Computer Technology class my senior year because I had enough credits to graduate, however they didn't let you do half days so this is what I chose to do with my time. The teacher was a great guy, nothing against him. I was in charge of keeping track of the laptops and signing them out. Mind you this was over 20 years ago so they were like IBM laptops with Pentium 2's and 2gb hard drives. For some reason I thought the school owed me something for not letting me leave early and work (The other surrounding schools if you had enough credits your senior year you only had to go half a day as long as your parents signed off saying it was for employment). I borrowed a laptop because my Pentium 1 PC could not do a lot of things I needed for school. I fudged the records to show that it was never taken out, and I was trusted so much it was never checked. They found out it was missing 2 years later but only by my sister telling me about it since she was a freshman at the time.",

I work in a gas station and today 20 minutes before closing the shop at 10 pm, a customer came in and wanted to buy 2 bags of candy 4$ each. Before her another customer came in to buy a bag of candy, but changed her mind. Me and the customer small talked a little and she seemed very nice, so i scanned her two bags of candy and she paid. Right as she paid i realised that i had put a bag of candy too much on her payment, but decided not to tell her because i was too tired to go through the refund proces. She looked like she belongs to the upper middle class and propably won‚Äôt realise my mistake, but i still instantly felt bad about not telling her about my mistake, and letting her walk out of the shop because of me being tired (or lazy).",

So when I was 15, I was working at McDonald‚Äôs and I purposefully drop a full load of BigMac boxes and told the manager that I was going to throw them away in the recycling bin in the back. I went there and proceed to tear every monopoly tickets on each box, and kept the winning ones. There was probably 150 boxes with 2 tickets per box (you have one in five chances to win so I ended up with a bunch of winning ones). So for the next few months, I went to another McDonald‚Äôs and order the free food with the tickets. I probably stole around 300-400$ worth of food.",

      "confession": "When I was 10 or 11, my whole family went on a trip around Arizona. Of course, during this road trip, we ended up stopping by Grand Canyon National Park, where we camped for a couple days. So eventually we hiked up to Yavapai Point to get a family photo. After we took the photo, while my mother and father were messing with the camera and enjoying the view, I, for some reason, decided to take my dad's telephone out of his hiking bag and throw it over the side. I'm not quite sure how nobody saw me doing this, but it fell a solid few hundred feet until I couldn't see it anymore. Obviously my dad noticed after a few hours that his cell phone was missing and spent the rest of the day looking for it. At this point I was seriously regretting my stupid impulsive decision but I kept my mouth shut. He got really upset because all of his old friend's contacts and photos were on this phone so the rest of the trip was ruined. When we got back, apparently his boss had been trying to call him nonstop for days over some sort of urgent work issue. I'm pretty sure this had something to do with my dad being fired a few months later. I'm writing this so many years later because I still feel really bad about this and I can't help but think that my life would be drastically different if I hadn't made that stupid decision.",

I picked making chocolate chip cookies so when I was going to present I had to show a step by step on how to make them so I had to bring in milk, eggs, bowls etc. We had 3 weeks to plan for the project but it was the day I had to present and I didn‚Äôt prepare or bring anything. So as soon as I got to school I went into my English class and told my teacher I didn‚Äôt have anything because my mom and dad got into a fight two night before and my dad kicked us out and we‚Äôve been living in a hotel. She said it was okay and that she would give me credit for my written part. The next week when I was in 3rd period I get called into the office. The school therapist was there and told me she wanted to talk to me. She asked me if everything was okay at home and I didn‚Äôt wanna have to do my project and get caught lying so I kept with the story that my dad kicked us out. I started crying and the therapist told me she would like to see me once a week. So I went for my whole senior year once a week to therapy to avoid doing one project.",
